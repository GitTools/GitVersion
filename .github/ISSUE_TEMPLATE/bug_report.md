**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

## Expected Behavior
<!-- Tell us what you believe should happen -->

## Actual Behavior
<!-- Tell us what is happening -->

## Possible Fix
<!-- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix or reason for the bug -->

## Steps to Reproduce
<!--
If you are able to write your bug or scenario up as a `RepositoryFixture` test
and submit a pull-request with it, it is going to increase the likelyhood of
the bug being fixed.

It will both make it easier to understand what you are trying to achieve, how
GitVersion deviates from this expectation and to start debugging the problem. It
will also make it easier for you to fix the problem yourself. Please look at the
following example for how such a test can look like:

https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion/blob/251645f08802ea9dc401d5b2f2d681e8f8adf626/src/GitVersionCore.Tests/IntegrationTests/MasterScenarios.cs#L13-L32

Otherwise, please provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of
steps to reproduce this bug.
