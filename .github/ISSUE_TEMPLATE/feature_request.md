## Detailed Description
<!---
Provide a detailed description of the change or addition you are proposing.

If you are able to write your feature or scenario up as a `RepositoryFixture`
test and submit a pull-request with it, it is going to increase the likelyhood
of the feature being implemented.

It will both make it easier to understand what you are trying to achieve, how
GitVersion deviates from this expectation and to start debugging the problem. It
will also make it easier for you to implement the feature yourself. Please look
at the following example for how such a test can look like:
