# Version Sources
GitVersion has a two step process for calculating the version number. First it calculates the base version, which is then used to calculate what the next version should be.

The logic of GitVersion is something like this:

 - Is the current commit tagged
   - Yes: Use the tag as the version
   - No: continue
 - Calculate the base version (highest version from all the sources)
 - Increment version if needed based on branch config
 - Calculate the build metadata (everything after the +) and append to the calculated version

## Version Sources
### Tag name
Returns the version numbers extracted from the current branch's tags.

Will increment: true

### Version in branch name
Returns the version number from the branch's name.

Will increment: false

### Merge message
Returns the version number of any branch (with a version number in its name) merged into the current branch.

Will increment: depends on the value of `prevent-increment-of-merged-branch-version`

### GitVersion.yml
Returns the value of the `next-version` property in the config file.

Will increment: false

### Develop branch
For the develop branch, i.e. marked with `is-develop: true`
- Returns the version number extracted from any child release-branches, i.e. those marked with `is-release-branch: true`
- Returns the version number of any tags on the master branch

Will increment: true 

### Fallback
Returns the version number `0.1.0`.

Will increment: false
