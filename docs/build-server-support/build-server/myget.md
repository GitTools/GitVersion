# MyGet

MyGet Build Services has built-in support for GitVersion and is encouraging you to leverage GitVersion + GitFlow to produce Semantically Versioned packages.

* Create a [custom build script](http://docs.myget.org/docs/reference/custom-build-scripts): we advise to run a tool like GitVersion in a *pre-build* script, so that it can set additional environment variables for the actual build script. MyGet [by convention](http://docs.myget.org/docs/reference/build-services#Pre-_and_post-build_steps) automatically picks up any of the following file names as pre-build script: 
  * `pre-build.(bat|cmd|ps1)`
  * `pre-myget.(bat|cmd|ps1)`
* Run `GitVersion /output buildserver`: this will cause MyGet Build Services to set the current `%PackageVersion%` value to the NuGet-compatible SemVer generated by GitVersion and apply this [MyGet Environment Variable](http://docs.myget.org/docs/reference/build-services#Available_Environment_Variables) wherever it is used during the build process.
* Ensure the build script has been pushed to your source repository root. Done :)

Note: If you require the `AssemblyInfo.cs` files in your project to be patched with the information from GitVersion, you will have to run it manually, for example using the command: 

`call %GitVersion% /updateassemblyinfo true`.
