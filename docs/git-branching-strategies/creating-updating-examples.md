# Creating/Updating Examples
The examples are generated by GitVersion tests, there are a number of services which will then turn the sequence diagram text into an image to use in the docs. Here are some links which could be useful

 - [PlantUML Sequence Diagrams](http://www.plantuml.com/sequence.html)
 - [CodeUML Online editor](http://www.codeuml.com/)
 - [PlantText Online editor](http://www.planttext.com/planttext)
 - [PlantUML gist renderer](http://uml.mvnsearch.org)

The tests are quite simple. Using the methods on the `fixture` itself will record that action in the sequence diagram. If you do not want the action recorded perform the action directly on the repository (`fixture.Repository.`)

The tests for the examples should all live at [DocumentationSamples.cs](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion/blob/master/src/GitVersionCore.Tests/IntegrationTests/DocumentationSamples.cs)
