## Release branch
Release branches can be used in GitHubFlow as well as GitFlow. Sometimes you want to start on a large feature which may take a while to stabilise so you want to keep it off master. In these scenarios you can either create a long lived feature branch (if you do not know the version number this large feature will go into, and it's non-breaking) otherwise you can create a release branch for the next major version. You can then submit pull requests to the long lived feature branch or the release branch.
