# Gem

Just a gem wrapper around the command line to make it easier to consume from Rake.

**NOTE** This is currently not being pushed.. Please get in touch if you are using this

If you want a Ruby gem version installed on your machine then you can use [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) or [Gem](http://rubygems.org/) to install the `gitversion` gem.

	gem install gitversion

The gem comes with a module to include in your Rakefile:

```ruby
require 'git_version'

include GitVersion

puts git_version.sha
```

Internally, this will call the `GitVersion.exe` that is bundled with the Ruby gem, parse its JSON output and make all the JSON keys available through Ruby methods. You can either use Pascal case (`git_version.InformationalVersion`) or Ruby-style snake case (`git_version.informational_version`) to access the JSON properties.

gitversion internally caches the JSON output, so `GitVersion.exe` is only called once.

Any arguments passed to `git_version` will be passed to `GitVersion.exe`:

```ruby
require 'git_version'

include GitVersion

puts git_version('C:/read/info/from/another/repository').sha
```

**Note:** Mono is not currently supported due to downstream dependencies on libgit2. The Gem can only be used with the .NET framework
