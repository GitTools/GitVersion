MyGet Build Services has built-in support for GitVersion and is encouraging you
to leverage GitVersion + GitFlow to produce Semantically Versioned packages.

* Create a [custom build script](http://docs.myget.org/docs/reference/custom-build-scripts):
we advise to run a tool like GitVersion in a *pre-build* script, so that it can
set additional environment variables for the actual build script. MyGet
[by convention](http://docs.myget.org/docs/reference/build-services#Pre-_and_post-build_steps)
automatically picks up any of the following file names as pre-build script:
  * `pre-build.(bat|cmd|ps1)`
  * `pre-myget.(bat|cmd|ps1)`
* Run `GitVersion /output buildserver`: this will cause MyGet Build Services to
set the current `%PackageVersion%` value to the NuGet-compatible SemVer
generated by GitVersion and apply this [MyGet Environment Variable](http://docs.myget.org/docs/reference/build-services#Available_Environment_Variables)
wherever it is used during the build process.
* Ensure the build script has been pushed to your source repository root. Done :)

**Note**

If you require the `AssemblyInfo.cs` files in your project to be patched
with the information from GitVersion, you will have to run it manually, for
example using the command:

`call %GitVersion% /updateassemblyinfo true`.
