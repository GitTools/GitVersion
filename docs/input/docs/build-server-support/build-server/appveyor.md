Title: AppVeyor Setup
---
AppVeyor is the first build server which has a setup helper built into
`GitVersion init`.

1. Run `GitVersion init`
2. Choose `Setup build scripts` (currently option 7, but that could change)
3. Choose `AppVeyor`
4. Follow the prompts to generate an AppVeyor.yml file which works nicely with GitVersion
