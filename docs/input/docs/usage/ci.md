## GitLab CI Pipelines

The GitLab CI example [Utterly Automated Software and Artifact Versioning with GitVersion][] implements GitVersion support at the pipeline level by using a single job that runs the GitVersion container and passes the version number downstream into both _pipeline_ and _job_ level variables. It is also implemented as a reusable CI/CD Extension that can be included in many different projects.
