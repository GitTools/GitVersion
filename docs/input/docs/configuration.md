Title: Configuration
---

GitVersion 3.0 is mainly powered by configuration and no longer has branching
strategies hard coded.

## Configuration tool

If you run `GitVersion init` you will be launched into a configuration tool, it
can help you configure GitVersion the way you want it.

Once complete, the `init` command will create a `GitVersion.yml` file in the
working directory. It can be the root repository directory or any subdirectory
in case you have a single repository for more than one project or are restricted
to commit into a subdirectory.

:::{.alert .alert-info}
**Note**

GitVersion ships with internal default configuration which works with
GitHubFlow and GitFlow, probably with others too.
:::

The *develop* branch is set to `ContinuousDeployment` mode by default as we have
found that is generally what is needed when using GitFlow.

You can run `GitVersion /showConfig` to see the effective configuration
(defaults + overrides).

To create your config file just type `GitVersion init` in your repo directory
after installing via chocolatey and a minimal `GitVersion.yml` configuration
file will be created. Modify this as you need.

## Global configuration

The global configuration look like this:

```yaml
next-version: 1.0
assembly-versioning-scheme: MajorMinorPatch
assembly-file-versioning-scheme: MajorMinorPatchTag
assembly-informational-format: '{InformationalVersion}'
mode: ContinuousDelivery
increment: Inherit
continuous-delivery-fallback-tag: ci
tag-prefix: '[vV]'
major-version-bump-message: '\+semver:\s?(breaking|major)'
minor-version-bump-message: '\+semver:\s?(feature|minor)'
patch-version-bump-message: '\+semver:\s?(fix|patch)'
no-bump-message: '\+semver:\s?(none|skip)'
legacy-semver-padding: 4
build-metadata-padding: 4
commits-since-version-source-padding: 4
commit-message-incrementing: Enabled
commit-date-format: 'yyyy-MM-dd'
ignore:
  sha: []
  commits-before: yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss
merge-message-formats: {}
```

And the description of the available options are:

### next-version

Allows you to bump the next version explicitly, useful for bumping `master` or a
feature with breaking changes a major increment.

### assembly-versioning-scheme

When updating assembly info, `assembly-versioning-scheme` tells GitVersion how
to treat the `AssemblyVersion` attribute. Useful to lock the major when using
Strong Naming. Note: you can use `None` to skip updating the `AssemblyVersion`
while still updating the `AssemblyFileVersion` and `AssemblyInformationVersion`
attributes. Valid values: `MajorMinorPatchTag`, `MajorMinorPatch`, `MajorMinor`,
`Major`, `None`.

### assembly-file-versioning-scheme

When updating assembly info, `assembly-file-versioning-scheme` tells GitVersion
how to treat the `AssemblyFileVersion` attribute. Note: you can use `None` to
skip updating the `AssemblyFileVersion` while still updating the
`AssemblyVersion` and `AssemblyInformationVersion` attributes. Valid values:
`MajorMinorPatchTag`, `MajorMinorPatch`, `MajorMinor`, `Major`, `None`.

### assembly-file-versioning-format

Set this to any of the available [variables](./more-info/variables) in
combination (but not necessary) with a process scoped environment variable. It
overwrites the value of `assembly-file-versioning-scheme`. To reference an
environment variable, use `env:` Example Syntax #1:

`'{Major}.{Minor}.{Patch}.{env:JENKINS_BUILD_NUMBER ?? fallback_string}'`.

Uses `JENKINS_BUILD_NUMBER` if available in the environment otherwise the
`fallback_string` Example Syntax #2:

`'{Major}.{Minor}.{Patch}.{env:JENKINS_BUILD_NUMBER}'`.

Uses `JENKINS_BUILD_NUMBER` if available in the environment otherwise the
parsing fails. String interpolation is supported as in
`assembly-informational-format`

### assembly-versioning-format

Follows the same semantics as `assembly-file-versioning-format` and overwrites
the value of `assembly-versioning-scheme`.

### assembly-informational-format

Set this to any of the available [variables](./more-info/variables) to change the
value of the `AssemblyInformationalVersion` attribute. Default set to
`{InformationalVersion}`. It also supports string interpolation
(`{MajorMinorPatch}+{BranchName}`)

### mode

Sets the `mode` of how GitVersion should create a new version. Read more at
[versioning modes](./reference/versioning-modes).

### increment

The part of the SemVer to increment when GitVersion detects it needs to be
increased, such as for commits after a tag: `Major`, `Minor`, `Patch`, `None`.

The special value `Inherit` means that GitVersion should find the parent branch
(i.e. the branch where the current branch was branched from), and use its values
for [increment](#increment),
[prevent-increment-of-merged-branch-version](#prevent-increment-of-merged-branch-version)
and [tracks-release-branches](#tracks-release-branches).

### continuous-delivery-fallback-tag

When using `mode: ContinuousDeployment`, the value specified in
`continuous-delivery-fallback-tag` will be used as the pre-release tag for
branches which do not have one specified. Default set to `ci`.

### tag-prefix

A regex which is used to trim git tags before processing (eg v1.0.0). Default is
`[vV]` though this is just for illustrative purposes as we do a IgnoreCase match
and could be `v`.

### major-version-bump-message

The regex to match commit messages with to perform a major version increment.
Default set to `'\+semver:\s?(breaking|major)'`, which will match occurrences of
`+semver: major` and `+semver: breaking` in a commit message.

### minor-version-bump-message

The regex to match commit messages with to perform a minor version increment.
Default set to `'\+semver:\s?(feature|minor)'`, which will match occurrences of
`+semver: feature` and `+semver: minor` in a commit message.

### patch-version-bump-message

The regex to match commit messages with to perform a patch version increment.
Default set to `'\+semver:\s?(fix|patch)'`, which will match occurrences of
`+semver: fix` and `+semver: patch` in a commit message.

### no-bump-message

Used to tell GitVersion not to increment when in Mainline development mode.
Default `\+semver:\s?(none|skip)`, which will match occurrences of `+semver:
none` and `+semver: skip`

### legacy-semver-padding

The number of characters to pad `LegacySemVer` to in the `LegacySemVerPadded`
[variable](./more-info/variables). Is default set to `4`, which will pad the
`LegacySemVer` value of `3.0.0-beta1` to `3.0.0-beta0001`.

### build-metadata-padding

The number of characters to pad `BuildMetaData` to in the `BuildMetaDataPadded`
[variable](./more-info/variables). Is default set to `4`, which will pad the
`BuildMetaData` value of `1` to `0001`.

### commits-since-version-source-padding

The number of characters to pad `CommitsSinceVersionSource` to in the
`CommitsSinceVersionSourcePadded` [variable](./more-info/variables). Is default
set to `4`, which will pad the `CommitsSinceVersionSource` value of `1` to
`0001`.

### commit-message-incrementing

Sets whether it should be possible to increment the version with special syntax
in the commit message. See the `*-version-bump-message` options above for
details on the syntax. Default set to `Enabled`; set to `Disabled` to disable.

### commit-date-format

Sets the format which will be used to format the `CommitDate` output variable.

### ignore

The header for ignore configuration.

#### sha

A sequence of SHAs to be excluded from the version calculations. Useful when
there is a rogue commit in history yielding a bad version. You can use either
style below:

```yaml
ignore:
  sha: [e7bc24c0f34728a25c9187b8d0b041d935763e3a, 764e16321318f2fdb9cdeaa56d1156a1cba307d7]
```

or

```yaml
ignore:
  sha:
    - e7bc24c0f34728a25c9187b8d0b041d935763e3a
    - 764e16321318f2fdb9cdeaa56d1156a1cba307d7
```

#### commits-before

Date and time in the format `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss` (eg `commits-before:
2015-10-23T12:23:15`) to setup an exclusion range. Effectively any commit before
`commits-before` will be ignored.

### merge-message-formats

Custom merge message formats to enable identification of merge messages that do not
follow the built-in conventions.  Entries should be added as key-value pairs where
the value is a regular expression.
e.g.

```yaml
merge-message-formats:
    tfs: ^Merged (?:PR (?<PullRequestNumber>\d+)): Merge (?<SourceBranch>.+) to (?<TargetBranch>.+)
```

The regular expression should contain the following capture groups:

+ SourceBranch - Identifies the source branch of the merge
+ TargetBranch - Identifies the target of the merge
+ PullRequestNumber - Captures the pull-request number

Custom merge message formats are evaluated _before_ any built in formats.

## Branch configuration

Then we have branch specific configuration, which looks something like this:

:::{.alert .alert-info}
**Note**

v4 changed from using regexes for keys, to named configs
:::

If you have branch specific configuration upgrading to v4 will force you to
upgrade.

```yaml
branches:
  master:
    regex: ^master
    mode: ContinuousDelivery
    tag: ''
    increment: Patch
    prevent-increment-of-merged-branch-version: true
    track-merge-target: false
    tracks-release-branches: false
    is-release-branch: false
  release:
    regex: ^releases?[/-]
    mode: ContinuousDelivery
    tag: beta
    increment: Patch
    prevent-increment-of-merged-branch-version: true
    track-merge-target: false
    tracks-release-branches: false
    is-release-branch: true
    pre-release-weight: 1000
  feature:
    regex: ^features?[/-]
    mode: ContinuousDelivery
    tag: useBranchName
    increment: Inherit
    prevent-increment-of-merged-branch-version: false
    track-merge-target: false
    tracks-release-branches: false
    is-release-branch: false
  pull-request:
    regex: ^(pull|pull\-requests|pr)[/-]
    mode: ContinuousDelivery
    tag: PullRequest
    increment: Inherit
    prevent-increment-of-merged-branch-version: false
    tag-number-pattern: '[/-](?<number>\d+)[-/]'
    track-merge-target: false
    tracks-release-branches: false
    is-release-branch: false
  hotfix:
    regex: ^hotfix(es)?[/-]
    mode: ContinuousDelivery
    tag: beta
    increment: Patch
    prevent-increment-of-merged-branch-version: false
    track-merge-target: false
    tracks-release-branches: false
    is-release-branch: false
  support:
    regex: ^support[/-]
    mode: ContinuousDelivery
    tag: ''
    increment: Patch
    prevent-increment-of-merged-branch-version: true
    track-merge-target: false
    tracks-release-branches: false
    is-release-branch: false
  develop:
    regex: ^dev(elop)?(ment)?$
    mode: ContinuousDeployment
    tag: unstable
    increment: Minor
    prevent-increment-of-merged-branch-version: false
    track-merge-target: true
    tracks-release-branches: true
    is-release-branch: false
```

If you don't specify the regex the inbuilt for that branch config will be used
(recommended)

We don't envision many people needing to change most of these configuration
values, but here they are if you need to:

### regex

This is the regex which is used to match the current branch to the correct
branch configuration.

### source-branches

Because git commits only refer to parent commits (not branches) GitVersion
sometimes cannot tell which branch the current branch was branched from.

Take this commit graph

```shell
* release/1.0.0   * feature/foo
| ________________/
|/
*
*
* (master)
```

By looking at this graph, you cannot tell which of these scenarios happened:

+ feature/foo branches off release/1.0.0
  + Branch release/1.0.0 from master
  + Branch feature/foo from release/1.0.0
  + Add a commit to both release/1.0.0 and feature/foo
  + release/1.0.0 is the base for feature/foo
+ release/1.0.0 branches off feature/foo
  + Branch feature/foo from master
  + Branch release/1.0.0 from feature/foo
  + Add a commit to both release/1.0.0 and feature/foo
  + feature/foo is the base for release/1.0.0

Or put more simply, you cannot tell which branch was created first,
`release/1.0.0` or `feature/foo`.

To resolve this issue, we give GitVersion a hint about our branching workflows
by telling it what types of branches a branch can be created from. For example,
feature branches are, by default, configured to have the following source
branches:

`source-branches: ['master', 'develop', 'feature', 'hotfix', 'support']`

This means that we will never bother to evaluate pull request branches as merge
base options and being explicit in this way also improves the performance of
GitVersion.

### is-source-branch-for

The reverse of `source-branches`. This property was introduced to keep it easy
to extend GitVersion's config.

It exists to make it easier to extend GitVersion's configuration. If only
`source-branches` exists and you add a new branch type, for instance
`unstable/`, you then need to re-define the `source-branches` configuration
value for existing branches (like feature/) to now include the new unstable
branch.

A complete example:

```yaml
branches:
  unstable:
    regex: ...
    is-source-branch-for: ['master', 'develop', 'feature', 'hotfix', 'support']
```

Without this configuration value you would have to do:

```yaml
branches:
  unstable:
    regex: ...
  feature:
    source-branches: ['unstable', 'develop', 'feature', 'hotfix', 'support']
  release:
    source-branches: ['unstable', 'develop']
  etc...
```

### branches

The header for all the individual branch configuration.

### mode

Same as for the [global configuration, explained above](#mode).

### tag

The pre release tag to use for this branch. Use the value `useBranchName` to use
the branch name instead. For example `feature/foo` would become a pre-release
tag of `foo` with this value. Use the value `{BranchName}` as a placeholder to
insert the branch name. For example `feature/foo` would become a pre-release tag
of `alpha.foo` with the value of `alpha.{BranchName}`.

**Note:** To clear a default use an empty string: `tag: ''`

### increment

Same as for the [global configuration, explained above](#increment).

### prevent-increment-of-merged-branch-version

When `release-2.0.0` is merged into master, we want master to build `2.0.0`. If
`release-2.0.0` is merged into develop we want it to build `2.1.0`, this option
prevents incrementing after a versioned branch is merged

### tag-number-pattern

Pull requests require us to extract the pre-release number out of the branch
name so `refs/pulls/534/merge` builds as `PullRequest.534`. This is a regex with
a named capture group called `number`.

If the branch `mode` is set to `ContinuousDeployment`, then the extracted
`number` is appended to the name of the pre-release tag and the number portion
is the number of commits since the last tag. This enables consecutive commits to
the pull request branch to generate unique full semantic version numbers when
the branch is configured to use ContinuousDeployment mode.

**Example usage:**

```yaml
branches:
  pull-request:
    mode: ContinuousDeployment
    tag: PullRequest
    increment: Inherit
    track-merge-target: true
    tag-number-pattern: '[/-](?<number>\d+)[-/]'
```

### track-merge-target

Strategy which will look for tagged merge commits directly off the current
branch. For example `develop` → `release/1.0.0` → merge into `master` and tag
`1.0.0`. The tag is *not* on develop, but develop should be version `1.0.0` now.

### tracks-release-branches

Indicates this branch config represents develop in GitFlow.

### is-release-branch

Indicates this branch config represents a release branch in GitFlow.

### is-mainline

When using Mainline mode, this indicates that this branch is a mainline. By
default support/ and master are mainlines.

### pre-release-weight

Provides a way to translate the `PreReleaseLabel`
([variables](./more-info/variables)) to a numeric value in order to avoid version
collisions across different branches. For example, a release branch created
after "1.2.3-alpha.55" results in "1.2.3-beta.1" and thus e.g. "1.2.3-alpha.4"
and "1.2.3-beta.4" would have the same file version: "1.2.3.4". One of the ways
to use this value is to set
`assembly-file-versioning-format: {Major}.{Minor}.{Patch}.{WeightedPreReleaseNumber}`.
If the `pre-release-weight` is set, it would be added to the `PreReleaseNumber`
to get a final `AssemblySemFileVer`, otherwise a branch specific default for
`pre-release-weight` will be used in the calculation. Related Issues
