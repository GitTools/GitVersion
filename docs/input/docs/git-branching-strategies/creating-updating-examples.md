Title: Creating/Updating Examples
---

The examples are generated by GitVersion tests, there are a number of services
which will then turn the sequence diagram text into an image to use in the docs.
Here are some links which could be useful

- [PlantUML Sequence Diagrams](http://www.plantuml.com/sequence.html)
- [CodeUML Online editor](http://www.codeuml.com/)
- [PlantText Online editor](http://www.planttext.com/planttext)
- [PlantUML gist renderer](http://uml.mvnsearch.org)

The tests are quite simple. Using the methods on the `fixture` itself will
record that action in the sequence diagram. If you do not want the action
recorded perform the action directly on the repository (`fixture.Repository.`)

The tests for the examples should all live at [DocumentationSamples.cs](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion/blob/master/src/GitVersionCore.Tests/IntegrationTests/DocumentationSamples.cs)
