GitHubFlow is a simple and effective branching strategy which the folks at
GitHub use. Most teams actually do not need everything GitFlow gives them and
are much better off with a simpler workflow.

GitHubFlow is in a nutshell:

1.  Update main to latest [upstream](/docs/learn/git-setup#upstream) code
2.  Create a feature branch `git checkout -b myFeatureBranch`
3.  Do the feature/work
4.  Push feature branch to [origin](/docs/learn/git-setup#origin)
5.  Create pull request from origin/<featureBranch> -> upstream/main
6.  Review, fix raised comments, merge your PR or even better, get someone else to.

The main rule of GitHub Flow is that main should _always_ be deployable.
GitHub Flow allows and encourages [continuous delivery](/docs/reference/modes/continuous-delivery).
