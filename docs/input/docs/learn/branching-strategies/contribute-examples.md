Title: Contribute Examples
Description: Contribute examples of how GitVersion works for your branching strategy

The examples are generated by GitVersion tests, there are a number of services
which will then turn the sequence diagram text into an image to use in the docs.
Here are some links which could be useful

*   [PlantUML Sequence Diagrams](http://www.plantuml.com/sequence.html)
*   [CodeUML Online editor](http://www.codeuml.com/)
*   [PlantText Online editor](http://www.planttext.com/planttext)
*   [PlantUML gist renderer](http://uml.mvnsearch.org)

The tests are quite simple. Using the methods on the `fixture` itself will
record that action in the sequence diagram. If you do not want the action
recorded perform the action directly on the repository (`fixture.Repository.`)

The tests for the examples should all live at [DocumentationSamples.cs](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion/blob/main/src/GitVersion.Core.Tests/IntegrationTests/DocumentationSamples.cs)
