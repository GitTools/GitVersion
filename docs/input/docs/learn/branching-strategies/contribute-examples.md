The examples are generated by GitVersion tests, there are a number of services
which will then turn the sequence diagram text into an image to use in the docs.
Here are some links which could be useful

*   [PlantUML Sequence Diagrams](https://www.plantuml.com/sequence.html)
*   [PlantText Online editor](https://www.planttext.com)

The tests are quite simple. Using the methods on the `fixture` itself will
record that action in the sequence diagram. If you do not want the action
recorded perform the action directly on the repository (`fixture.Repository.`)

The tests for the examples should all live at [DocumentationSamples.cs](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion/blob/main/src/GitVersion.Core.Tests/IntegrationTests/DocumentationSamples.cs)
