Version variables are quite useful if you need different formats of the version
number. Running the `gitversion` executable in your repository will show you
what is available. For the `release/3.0.0` branch of GitVersion it shows:

```json
{
    "Major": 3,
    "Minor": 22,
    "Patch": 11,
    "PreReleaseTag": "beta.99",
    "PreReleaseTagWithDash": "-beta.99",
    "PreReleaseLabel": "beta",
    "PreReleaseLabelWithDash": "-beta",
    "PreReleaseNumber": 99,
    "WeightedPreReleaseNumber": 1099,
    "BuildMetaData": 88,
    "FullBuildMetaData": "99.Branch.release/3.22.11.Sha.28c853159a46b5a87e6cc9c4f6e940c59d6bc68a",

Each property of the above JSON document is described in the below table.

Depending on how and in which context GitVersion is executed (for instance
within a [supported build server][build-servers]), the above version variables
may be exposed automatically as **environment variables** in the format
`GitVersion_FullSemVer`.
