    Sometimes you just want the version to keep changing and deploy continuously.

Continuous Deployment is the process of checking into main and automatically
deploying to production.

For this mode we follow the logic in [this blog post by Xavier Decoster][blog]
on the issues of incrementing automatically.

## How Continuous Deployment affects GitVersion

The thing about continuous deployment is that there will be only one version
to deploy on production. This means that GitVersion will build
**the same semantic version** for every commit until it has been tagged. For instance:

* 1.2.0
* 1.1.0 (tag: 1.1.0) <-- This is the version which has been deployed on production
* 1.1.0
* 1.1.0

Tags are required in this mode to communicate when the deployment happens on production.
