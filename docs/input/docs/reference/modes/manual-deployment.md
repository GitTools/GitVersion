Having not the necessity to deploy the build artifacts on every commit is an
indecation of using the **Manual Deployment** mode. This mode can be used to
remain on the same pre-released version until it has been deployed dedicatedly.

## How Manual Deployment affects GitVersion

The thing about manual deployment is that there will be _multiple_ candidates
to deploy on testing and it is a human choice to deploy. This means that
GitVersion will build **the same semantic version** until that version is
deployed. For instance:

* 1.1.0-2+1
* 1.1.0-1+2 (tag: 1.1.0-1) <-- This is the version which has been deployed on testing
* 1.1.0-1+1
* 1.1.0-1+0

Tags are required in this mode to communicate when the release is done as it's
an external manual process.
