To use GitVersion with GitLab CI, either use the [MSBuild
Task](/docs/usage/msbuild) or put the GitVersion executable in your
runner's `PATH`.

A working example of integrating GitVersion with GitLab is maintained in the project [Utterly Automated Software and Artifact Versioning with GitVersion][]

Here is a summary of what it demonstrated (many more details in the [README.md][])

- Is a reusable working example known as a Guided Exploration ([GE Manifesto][]) - so job logs and package artifacts can be reviewed. The project can also be imported to your own GitLab group or instance as a starting point for your own work.
- IMPORTANT: It demonstrates how to override GitLab CI's default cloning behavior so that GitVersion can do a dynamic copy. Selectively clones GitVersion.yml so that these settings take effect. This best practice demonstrates the best way to do this while avoiding a double-cloning of the project (once by GitLab Runner and once by GitVersion). 
- Implements GitVersion as a CI/CD Extension that can be reused across many projects using includes.
- Implements GitVersion as a single job that runs the GitVersion container and passes the version number downstream into both _pipeline_ and _job_ level variables, which means...
- It can be used with ANY coding language, framework or packaging engine.
- Generates example packaged artifacts:
  - Two ways of building Sem Versioned NuGet packages (msbuild-ish and nuget.exe-ish) and uploads them and tests them from a [GitLab NuGet repository][].
  - A Sem Versioned [GitLab Generic Package][]
  - A Sem Versioned docker container and uploads to [GitLabs Container Registry][].
- It creates a Sem Versioned [GitLab Release](GitLab Releases Feature Help) and Git tag using the [GitLab release-cli][] and links the generic package as evidence.
