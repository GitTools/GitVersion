# GitVersion Documentation

This is the directory in which the [GitVersion documentation hosted on GitHub
Pages][gitversion.net] resides.

## Contributing

Improvements to the documentation is highly welcomed and is as easy
as finding the `.md` file you want to change and editing it directly within
GitHub's web interface.

If you want to do more elaborate changes, we would appreciate if you could test
the documentation locally before submitting a pull request. This involves
[forking][forking] this repository and then serving up the documentation locally
on your machine, clicking around in it to ensure that everything works as
expected.

## Serving the documentation locally

To serve up the documentation locally, you need to run the `build.ps1` script
with the arguments `-Target Preview-Documentation`.

### On Windows

On Windows, you need to run the following build command in a PowerShell
terminal:

```shell
.\build.ps1 -Target Preview-Documentation
```

### On Unix

First you need to [install PowerShell on macOS][ps-mac] or [Linux][ps-linux],
then execute the following command:

```shell
pwsh build.ps1 -Target Preview-Documentation
```

After pressing enter, the documentation will be generated and then served under
a local web server.  Information about the URL that can be used to view the docs
will be shown in the output.  Copy/paste this URL into a browser window.
